Question: analyse the codebase of this project
Answer: This project is a TensorFlow-Streamlit application that uses a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model to classify images into different categories. The purpose of the project is to provide a user interface where users can upload an image and get a prediction of the object in the image.

The codebase consists of three files: requirement.txt, scr.py, and streamlit_host.py.

1. requirement.txt: This file specifies the dependencies required for the project, including streamlit, tensorflow, and opencv-python.

2. scr.py: This file imports the necessary libraries and loads the Iris dataset using the sklearn library. However, it seems unrelated to the main functionality of the project.

3. streamlit_host.py: This is the main file that hosts the Streamlit application. It imports the necessary libraries, including cv2, numpy, streamlit, and tensorflow. It also loads the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model from the "saved_model/mdl_wts.hdf5" file.

The file then defines a function to convert the uploaded file to an OpenCV image and resize it to (224, 224) pixels. It displays the uploaded image using the st.image() function.

When the "Generate Prediction" button is clicked, the resized image is preprocessed using the mobilenet_v2_preprocess_input() function. The preprocessed image is then passed to the loaded model for prediction. The predicted label is displayed using the st.title() function.

Overall, the codebase provides a simple web application where users can upload an image and get a prediction of the object in the image using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model.

To set up and use the project, you would need to install the dependencies specified in the requirement.txt file. Then, you can run the streamlit_host.py file using the command "streamlit run streamlit_host.py". This will start the Streamlit application, and you can access it in your web browser.
